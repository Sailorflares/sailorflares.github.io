    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thursday morning, 9:24. We&rsquo;re basically being given all day to do our labs, and this is really awesome. But, I just find that, for whatever reason, right now I feel like writing. And once again, I open the page and it&rsquo;s blank and I feel like everything I&rsquo;ve written up to this point, right here, is just awful. But, eh, who cares.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m working on finding balance. This practically 80 hour a week program, more time consuming than school (albeit a different stress - not having strictly enforced deadlines or grades makes it seem much more real world and much less purely academic). But balance. How much sleep should I get? How much should I really worry about how messy the apartment is? How much should I work out? How much time should I spend at night finishing a lab (instead of sleeping)?</p>

<p>You get it. The biggest challenge I&rsquo;m really facing in all of this is mindset. I come home, I feel so exhasted that I repeat to myself how exhausted I am and that mentally alters my ability to work. It sucks, and I&rsquo;m working really hard on overcoming it.&#8217;</p>
