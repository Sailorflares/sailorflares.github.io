    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first real post, so expect a little terseness. In fact, I&rsquo;m barely going to only write that I&rsquo;ve decided on a theme for my blog. That is, I want to document as much as possible all of the assumptions that I&rsquo;m making while writing my labs.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s the first example. I was working on a method and when I inspected the elements, I could see that my method was running perfectly but the rspec tests were still not passing. The assumption I made was that the return type of my method was correct. Turned out my method didn&rsquo;t return a the hash that the test was expecting.</p>

<p>That was the assumption. This is the direction my blog will be taking. :) Happy Saturday!</p>
