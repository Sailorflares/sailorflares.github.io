<div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in high school, I had a crush on a friend who used the school gym after hours. Being an inane teenaged girl, I went to the gym with him and dutifully got on the weight machines and pulled some weight. After a few consistent weeks of going, I remember vaguely questioning, &ldquo;Why am I not getting any stronger?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t end up &lsquo;crushing&rsquo; it at the gym for long, but I always felt like an intruder in that space. I was the epitome of the female nerd, excelling in math and science but definitely not following fashion trends. I think I even once wore to school an XXL hoodie over top of an asymetrical skirt, which was barely visible under all that fuzz. Yikes. Not that there weren&rsquo;t the cross-overs, students on sports teams and taking AP classes, but that wasn&rsquo;t my territory. I was just a nerd and when I walked into that weight room, I felt like everybody knew I didn&rsquo;t belong there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the only person who felt like the gym wasn&rsquo;t the place for me. That mentally that somehow, you have get into shape to even be allowed in the gym. That only certain types of people workout. Take a look at the Planet Fitness advertising campagin, guaranteeing that there are no &lsquo;lunks&rsquo; at their gyms.</p>

<p><img src="http://bgg2wlplugins.bgg2wl.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/planet-fitness.jpg"></p>

<p>The entire success of this chain, which has made over $500 million in revenue, is its &lsquo;anti-fitness fitness club&rsquo; branding. AKA, you don&rsquo;t have to &lsquo;know&rsquo; about working out to work out, nor do you have to already fit in to fitness.</p>

<p>Alright, so where does coding come into this blog post? Well, like working out, you don&rsquo;t have to &lsquo;know&rsquo; how to code to start coding. This advice seems hackneyed when spoken out loud, and it goes for almost any hobby/skill/profession&hellip; but for whatever reason there are certain fields, and coding is one of them, where it seems a huge intimidation factor looms and the very existence of experts precludes your ability to be a beginner.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say it explicitly: that&rsquo;s complete shit. Yeah, you look dumb the first time you write a loop or the first time you pick up a barbell to work on an overhead squat. But you aren&rsquo;t going to look any less dumb doing it until&hellip; you do it, again, and again, and again.</p>

<p>But at the heart of the issue is this: don&rsquo;t worry that you&rsquo;re a &lsquo;coding person&rsquo; or a &lsquo;fitness person&rsquo; or any other kind of person. I think what really stops a lot of people from learning new skills or even getting in shape is the fact that they&rsquo;ve never done it before. When I was in that gym, most of the reason I didn&rsquo;t get anywhere is that I didn&rsquo;t think I belonged there. I was a nerd, not an athlete, and so I was afraid of even looking like I was trying. And so I never really did any work of substance, and I never grew any muscle at all.</p>

<p>Some are lucky and start their lives doing the thing they want to do from day one. (This is particually helpful if you want to become an olympic gymnast.) However, most things in life don&rsquo;t work like that, and can be picked up at any point in life. For a really good story, check out Tim Olson, an ultra marathon runner.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.timothyallenolson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/start.jpeg" width="600"></p>

<p>He only STARTED running in 2009 and has already broken ultra marathon records. It&rsquo;s just crazy. But he started like anybody else starts - running a mile on day and thinking that he kind of liked it, or at least not stopping after first huff and puff.</p>

<p>For all this, what Planet Fitness has in terms of getting you in the door and picking up a weight, it lacks in terms of helping you become more fit in the long-term. I won&rsquo;t even go into the more technical side of why no serious atlethe would want to work out at Planet Fitness anyways, and heck, I&rsquo;m currently a member. But the point is that without more knowledgeable athletes(and maybe even a few meat heads) to look up to, along with a whole other host of resources, the amount of people really become fit at Planet Fitness will be&hellip; not a lot. You need people before you to show you how things are done and to teach you. (I could do a whole other post here about how the idea of apprenticeship needs to be brought back to our learning, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another day) And you need the struggle of figuring stuff out, to figure stuff out.</p>

<p>I could keep listing somewhat vague statements like the previous, but let&rsquo;s move on to some practical advice:</p>

<p>*Read Biographies</p>

<p>If you ever feel like you&rsquo;re too old or too much not &lsquo;that kind of person&rsquo;, just pick up a biography at your local library (shameless plug). You&rsquo;ll be surprised by the number of men and women whom we see as being &lsquo;an actor&rsquo; or &lsquo;a politician&rsquo; or any other label, didn&rsquo;t start out that way. Many started out with a whole lotta not-what-they-are-known-for. But the difference is that they did until they were.</p>

<p>*Read the Fucking Manual</p>

<p><img src="http://www.heaveyduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SnatchPowerPosition.jpg" width="350"></p>

<p>This just goes for learning, in general. Want to learn how to do some power lifting? Look at this picture and note the important position of the banana sandbag. Try it. Look at it before you try the lift, after you try the lift, and every single day until you get it.</p>

<p>Want to code? Check out Stack Overflow. Read and read and read. Don&rsquo;t worry about if what you&rsquo;re learning is correct. The more you read and the more you practice, you&rsquo;ll naturally uncover the right way (or your way) of doing things. It&rsquo;s true you might encounter some snarky remarks, but ask your dumb question anyways. If you&rsquo;re super off track, don&rsquo;t worry, some friendly neighbor internet friend will let you know what&rsquo;s up. Even if they&rsquo;re an ass when they do it, you can still glean information.</p>

<p>*Copying is a legitimate way to learn</p>

<p><img src="http://www.sturdyforcommonthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_6260.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Many artists first learn techniques by copying masters that came before them. If you find that you can&rsquo;t understand an implementation in code, copying that code can be helpful as a step to understanding. Don&rsquo;t ever forget that the end goal is understanding, but copy can give your hands the feel of the right thing to do and get your brain on the right track. Also, treat coding like a language - look up words you don&rsquo;t know! It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<p>*Know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>

<p><img src="http://bestbodybootcamp.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Planck.jpg"></p>

<p>This may sound counter-intuitive to my whole post above, but I promise you it&rsquo;s not. Know what you are doing at any given moment - what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish, what your problem is, how you&rsquo;re approaching it. At any given moment, try to be as self-aware as possible. Even though I sometimes do this, don&rsquo;t just type in different forms of syntax aimlessly until something works. At least know what you&rsquo;re changing, even if it&rsquo;s just a shot in that dark. That way, once you do find the right path, you&rsquo;ll already know what you changed to work.</p>

<p>*Don&rsquo;t give a damn about how stupid you look, or how slow you are, or anything, really.</p>

<p>Really. Be the nerd in the gym and be damn proud of it. Jump over to Nerd Fitness and see what that&rsquo;s about.</p>

<p>Get a code workout. It&rsquo;s okay if you start out as this guy:</p>

<p>Just don&rsquo;t stay there forever.</p>
