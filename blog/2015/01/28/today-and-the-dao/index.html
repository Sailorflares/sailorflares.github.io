<div class="entry-content"><p>So last night I actually succeeded in writing a to-do list for today. The scrap of paper that holds the unnumbered list is floating amongst a barrage of doodly pieces of paper that are helping me in thinking out the development of my app, Remedy. Which is to say that there is a lot of brainstorming going on today, and not a lot of braindoing. One thing is crossed off that list, and it was just a phone call.</p>

<p>Keep my hands on the keys&hellip; Keep my hands on the keys. This is a piece of advice that my boyfriend always gives me. It&rsquo;s definitely applying to this blog right now. I have a ton of ideas in this little old head of mine right now, but quite frankly, my hands usually migrate to my hair, which I twist and pull and generally harass all day. Instead of doing.</p>

<p>But even though writing this blog post has come down to that college gotta-write-a-paper feeling (the number one thing you need to do, and the number last thing you want to do), the fingers stay on the keyboard and I just keep typing. Because here is the point of Part I:</p>

<p>Progress comes down to forcing yourself to do what you don&rsquo;t feel motivated to do, and that makes progress a bitch.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s start with that first one, which I experience last week. Last Thursday, to be exact. Let me give you the brief set up. I&rsquo;ve recently finished a coding bootcamp at the Flatiron School in NYC. It&rsquo;s awesome. But 12 hours after graduation, I set off in a plane to Peru, and promptly (apparently) forgot everything I had learned in that three month time period. I will even admit to a botched interview that was two-thirds nervousness and one-third post-vacation haze. I spent a good amount of time saying URL instead of HTML. It was embarrassing.</p>

<p>So, I needed to get myself back in the learning groove. There were a few days of partial productivity, with me kind of hastily reading over topics but not &lsquo;having the time&rsquo; to actually code. I wanted to get back to the feeling of having the knowledge. So, for a few days, every time I came across something I didn&rsquo;t know, I just read about it and sort of hoped that I&rsquo;d remind the info on &lsquo;test&rsquo; day.</p>

<p>Through all of this motion, I was hiding the fact that I was terrified to start writing in my app again. Looking back at code that was barely a month young, I felt like I didn&rsquo;t understand any of it. Was I even qualified to be a developer now that I was looking? What the heck do I even know how to do? Every time I thought about writing more code, I glanced over some easy stuff and got distracted. That is, until I made myself realize that I was never going to get back to it if I didn&rsquo;t force myself to do it. Because there was no way I was going to just jump over that hurdle &lsquo;because I felt like it&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s what I did last Thursday. I woke up on time, got dressed right away and sat down and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rewrite my old app from scratch.&rdquo; Of course, there were dreams in there of brilliant refactoring and the like, and this probably fueled me for the first two minutes. And then I realized, &ldquo;Shit. I don&rsquo;t remember any of this&rdquo; and it was back to the documentation. Back to some railscasts and stack overflow that I had looked at one like day two of Rails. Once again, the feeling of gloom.</p>

<p>And this is the point where there is a choice to be made. I decided to force myself to move forward, no matter how damn slowly it went. So I spent that entire day, and besides standard Rails setup, probably wrote about 5 lines of code. And every single second of it was a challenge to not just go watch TV, or nap, or even do a housechore that I had put off. (Note: Side benefit of this stage, you start procrastinating with the other tasks you have to get done. My kitchen is very clean right now :)</p>

<p>And then, at the end of the day I was exhausted. But, I really, I actually knew what I had written. I actually could look at my old code understand it again. I actually even felt excited about what I was doing, instead of that sense of dread. And you know what? The next day, I got up and coded. There was no sense of not wanting to do it or not feeling motivated.</p>

<p>I faced what was hindering my progress. Not with desire, but with the mindset that I was going to keep my fingers on the keys until the hurdle was overcome, no matter how it felt. And now, it feels good and I think the motivation will at least last until next week, when I&rsquo;ll have to climb the hurdle again.</p>
