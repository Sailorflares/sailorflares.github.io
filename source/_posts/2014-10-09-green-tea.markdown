Thursday morning, 9:24. We're basically being given all day to do our labs, and this is really awesome. But, I just find that, for whatever reason, right now I feel like writing. And once again, I open the page and it's blank and I feel like everything I've written up to this point, right here, is just awful. But, eh, who cares.

So I'm working on finding balance. This practically 80 hour a week program, more time consuming than school (albeit a different stress - not having strictly enforced deadlines or grades makes it seem much more real world and much less purely academic). But balance. How much sleep should I get? How much should I really worry about how messy the apartment is? How much should I work out? How much time should I spend at night finishing a lab (instead of sleeping)?

You get it. The biggest challenge I'm really facing in all of this is mindset. I come home, I feel so exhasted that I repeat to myself how exhausted I am and that mentally alters my ability to work. It sucks, and I'm working really hard on overcoming it.'
