This is a post about why I'm panicking. I don't think it's going to aount to much beyond a personal assessment. Why? Because, if I can't handle life, I can't handle code. So I am going to take this blog time to talk about the thing that is incredibly stressing me out right now: life.

What's that's definitely a bit of a general topic, "Hey, what's wrong?" / "Oh, you know, life." Doesn't really tell anybody anything about what's realling going on in my head. But that' basically what I tell myself when I have that inner conversation. And, well that's kind of like, as I think of it, looking at a program and asking What's wrong? And answering "The code." Nobody has ever debugged a program that way, and my guess is that nobody ever got over a panic attack like that, either.

So let's do it. I'm going to be as granular as possible. Write out line by line everything I can think of that's preventing me from thinking/coding/otherthingsing.

1. Schoolwork
2. Housework
3. Budgeting

Hm... still too broad. Let's dig a little deeper.

1. Schoolwork
  a. A bazillion ironboard labs.
  b. A blog post
  c. Shit, when is my presentation again?
  d. Uh, I have to make something for a science fair? When the hell am I going to have time for that?

2. Housework
  a. Cooking some sort of food.
  b. The sink is disgusting.
  c. The floor is a mess.
  d. I don't think I've done laundry in three weeks

3. Budgeting
  a. I have $50 to get me through the week. 
  b. I took on an extra 3 hours of work because of that first line.

Well, that's much better. I could go into further detail, but for now this is good enough. See, the way I want to deal with stress (and this is not considered a healthy reaction) is to look at that long list and go curl up into bed and sleep/cry until it's too late or I'm too tired to do anything. Then I momentarily feel better with a "I'll just go to sleep now and start fresh tomorrow", essentially pushing the reset button. 

And here is the point of my blog: One step at a time. Here is what I am going to promise myself to do for the rest of the night. Pick one thing on that list, be it the easiest or shortest or funnest or most important, and do that. And then worry about the next thing.

But stop looking at the big picture, because the big picture likes to intimidate the shit out of you.

Let's see if I can do it.
