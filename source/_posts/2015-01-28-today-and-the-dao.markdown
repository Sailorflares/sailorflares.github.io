So last night I actually succeeded in writing a to-do list for today. The scrap of paper that holds the unnumbered list is floating amongst a barrage of doodly pieces of paper that are helping me in thinking out the development of my app, Remedy. Which is to say that there is a lot of brainstorming going on today, and not a lot of braindoing. One thing is crossed off that list, and it was just a phone call.

Keep my hands on the keys... Keep my hands on the keys. This is a piece of advice that my boyfriend always gives me. It's definitely applying to this blog right now. I have a ton of ideas in this little old head of mine right now, but quite frankly, my hands usually migrate to my hair, which I twist and pull and generally harass all day. Instead of doing. 

But even though writing this blog post has come down to that college gotta-write-a-paper feeling (the number one thing you need to do, and the number last thing you want to do), the fingers stay on the keyboard and I just keep typing. Because here is the point of Part I:

Progress comes down to forcing yourself to do what you don't feel motivated to do, and that makes progress a bitch.

So, let's start with that first one, which I experience last week. Last Thursday, to be exact. Let me give you the brief set up. I've recently finished a coding bootcamp at the Flatiron School in NYC. It's awesome. But 12 hours after graduation, I set off in a plane to Peru, and promptly (apparently) forgot everything I had learned in that three month time period. I will even admit to a botched interview that was two-thirds nervousness and one-third post-vacation haze. I spent a good amount of time saying URL instead of HTML. It was embarrassing. 

So, I needed to get myself back in the learning groove. There were a few days of partial productivity, with me kind of hastily reading over topics but not 'having the time' to actually code. I wanted to get back to the feeling of having the knowledge. So, for a few days, every time I came across something I didn't know, I just read about it and sort of hoped that I'd remind the info on 'test' day.

Through all of this motion, I was hiding the fact that I was terrified to start writing in my app again. Looking back at code that was barely a month young, I felt like I didn't understand any of it. Was I even qualified to be a developer now that I was looking? What the heck do I even know how to do? Every time I thought about writing more code, I glanced over some easy stuff and got distracted. That is, until I made myself realize that I was never going to get back to it if I didn't force myself to do it. Because there was no way I was going to just jump over that hurdle 'because I felt like it'

So, that's what I did last Thursday. I woke up on time, got dressed right away and sat down and said "I'm going to rewrite my old app from scratch." Of course, there were dreams in there of brilliant refactoring and the like, and this probably fueled me for the first two minutes. And then I realized, "Shit. I don't remember any of this" and it was back to the documentation. Back to some railscasts and stack overflow that I had looked at one like day two of Rails. Once again, the feeling of gloom.

And this is the point where there is a choice to be made. I decided to force myself to move forward, no matter how damn slowly it went. So I spent that entire day, and besides standard Rails setup, probably wrote about 5 lines of code. And every single second of it was a challenge to not just go watch TV, or nap, or even do a housechore that I had put off. (Note: Side benefit of this stage, you start procrastinating with the other tasks you have to get done. My kitchen is very clean right now :)

And then, at the end of the day I was exhausted. But, I really, I actually knew what I had written. I actually could look at my old code understand it again. I actually even felt excited about what I was doing, instead of that sense of dread. And you know what? The next day, I got up and coded. There was no sense of not wanting to do it or not feeling motivated. 

I faced what was hindering my progress. Not with desire, but with the mindset that I was going to keep my fingers on the keys until the hurdle was overcome, no matter how it felt. And now, it feels good and I think the motivation will at least last until next week, when I'll have to climb the hurdle again.
