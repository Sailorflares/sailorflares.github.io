This is my first real post, so expect a little terseness. In fact, I'm barely going to only write that I've decided on a theme for my blog. That is, I want to document as much as possible all of the assumptions that I'm making while writing my labs. 

So, here's the first example. I was working on a method and when I inspected the elements, I could see that my method was running perfectly but the rspec tests were still not passing. The assumption I made was that the return type of my method was correct. Turned out my method didn't return a the hash that the test was expecting.

That was the assumption. This is the direction my blog will be taking. :) Happy Saturday!
